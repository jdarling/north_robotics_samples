# NORTH Robotics Samples

This is a collection of how to control or use different parts of the robotics kit we are using in the NORTH Homeschooling group.

The kit consists of:

 * 1 - BBC micro:bit Go kit
 * 1 - Keyestudio Sensor Breakout Board for BBC micro:bit
 * 1 - 2 wheeled robot chassis kit
 * 3 - 9 gram micro servos
 * 1 - DAOKI 5PCS TCRT5000 Infrared Reflective Sensor Module
 * 1 - 400 Point Solderless Breadboard
 * 1 - 9V Battery Snap Clip
 * 1 - 4 AA Battery Holder
 * 1 - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module Kit
 * 1 - L298N Motor Drive Controller Module
 * Random LED's
 * Random Zip Ties
 * M3 nut, spacer, and screw assortment

With this kit the students can create a variety of projects.  This repository contains sample code of how to work with each part in the kit.

## Agenda:

*Day 1:*

Introduction, safety, and assembly of the basic kit.

 * All classes will include safety, but it is only mentioned on Day 1.

*Day 2:*

Completed assembly and introduction to the basics of programming each kit.  We will cover how to make motors move and light up the lights on the controller.  For the sumo this will cover turning on one or the other drive motor, moving forward/back, turning left/right.  For the arm it will cover moving each of the 4 servos to a predefined position.

*Day 3:*

The difference between systems.  Electronics have different needs, motors require more power than controllers, LED's (Lights) have different control needs than motors.  This hour will get deep into the physical and technical differences and requirements of the parts of the robots.

*Day 4:*

More on programming.

*Day 5:*

Scavenging parts and modifying robots.  What does it mean to be a maker, where to look for parts, how to identify things you can work with.  How to identify the things you find.

*Day 6:*

Introduction to final tasks.

*Day 7-9:*

Working to complete the final tasks.  If students complete the one they chose to work on initially they may select a more advanced task to start working on.

*Day 10:*

Can you do it.  Show off final projects and review what was learned during the process.
